  ask it to generate multiple scenes and give visual descriptions for them
- copy paste scene descriptions into image generator (
@ideogram_ai
  here)
- copy paste generated images into 
@runwayml
 Gen 3 Alpha to make each image into a 10-second video
- ask Claude to generate lyrics that depict that day
- copy paste lyrics into

  to generate music
- stitch things up in iMovie
